        <h1>Shopping In Amman</h1>
        <h3>Amman is a shopping paradise offering goods ranging from international designer clothes to hand made, locally produced items.</h3>
        <p>As far as local products go, Jordan is famous for its mosaics which are still produced to this day in the Madaba area. You can also shop for beautiful hand made rugs, (which can be made to order), traditional sand bottles, ceramics, Dead Sea Salts, mud and beauty products and silver and gold articles. The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature sells a wide range of community produced foodstuffs which are organically grown by people living near the nature reserves of Dana and Ajlun. Also on offer are hand made jewellery that reflect the diversity of Jordan’s flora and fauna.</p>

                <h3>Souq Jara</h3>
                Souq JARA, also spelled Souk Jara, is among the best events the city of Amman has to offer.  It takes place each year, typically when the city is experiencing the onset of spring.  To find out when the souq is going to take place in the year that you do visit, look up announcements online from the Jabal Amman Residents Association, after which the market is named.  This association manages and organises the souq every year, as is natural given that it takes place within their territory, in Fawzy Malouf Street on Jabal Amman.
